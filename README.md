* Task: I needed to calculate the lowest, highest, median, and mode of the array [1,4,3,4,5,7,7,8,9,10] and output these values.
* Approach: I iterated to find the lowest and highest numbers, sorted a copy of the array to compute the median, and used lists to count occurrences for the mode.
* Result: The code outputs lowest (1), highest (10), median (6), and mode (7) (see question6ResultsScreenshot.jpeg).
* Challenges: My initial mode calculation was incomplete, but I finalized it by tracking counts and identifying the highest frequency. Edge cases like multiple modes were handled.
* Source Code Reference: The method CalculateStats in StatsCalculator.cs computes all required statistics.
